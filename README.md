# FPGA Implementation of Elliptic IIR Low-Pass Filter Architectures on EBAZ4205

A fixed-point DSP project that designs, implements, simulates, and
evaluates elliptic IIR low-pass filters on the **EBAZ4205 board with the
Xilinx Zynq XC7Z010 FPGA**. The project compares three RTL architectures
and validates the filtering system using a real analog signal path.

## Project Overview

The goal is to compare the filtering behavior, FPGA resource usage,
timing, and processing latency of different IIR implementations using
Verilog and fixed-point arithmetic.

The project includes: - Elliptic low-pass filter design and coefficient
quantization in MATLAB. - Three Verilog filter architectures: DF1 single
biquad, DF1 cascade, and TDF2 cascade. - SPI-based acquisition from an
MCP3208 12-bit ADC. - Test-signal generation using an ESP32 and MCP4921
12-bit DAC. - UART transmission of filtered samples to a PC for waveform
and frequency-domain analysis. - RTL simulation and hardware validation,
with FPGA utilization and timing analysis in Vivado.

The end-to-end hardware path makes it possible to evaluate the filter
beyond RTL simulation, including ADC/DAC behavior, SPI communication,
fixed-point arithmetic, and UART data transfer.

The fourth-order filter is factored into two second-order sections
(biquads) for the cascade implementations. The DF1 single-biquad design
is a second-order reference architecture; therefore, it is not an
equal-order comparison against the two fourth-order cascade designs.

## Implemented Architectures

### 1. Direct Form I --- Single Biquad (DF1)

-   Second-order filter.
-   Implements the feedforward and feedback paths directly from the
    difference equation.
-   Provides a simpler baseline architecture.

### 2. Direct Form I --- Cascade (DF1 Cascade)

-   Fourth-order filter implemented as two cascaded biquad sections.
-   Uses separate input and output delay paths in each DF1 section.
-   Provides a useful balance of resource usage and timing in the
    measured implementation.

### 3. Transposed Direct Form II --- Cascade (TDF2 Cascade)

-   Fourth-order filter implemented as two cascaded TDF2 biquad
    sections.
-   Uses a transposed state-space arrangement.
-   Uses fewer DSP blocks than DF1 Cascade in the reported
    implementation, while requiring more LUTs and flip-flops.

## FPGA Implementation Results

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key observations** - All three architectures met the 50 MHz timing
constraint in the reported implementation. - DF1 Cascade had the largest
positive WNS and the lowest LUT count among the two fourth-order cascade
implementations. - TDF2 Cascade used 3 fewer DSP blocks than DF1
Cascade, but used more LUTs, flip-flops, and slices. - The DF1 single
biquad is second order, while both cascade implementations are fourth
order; resource comparisons should be interpreted with this difference
in mind.

Latency is measured from a valid ADC sample entering the filter core
until the corresponding filtered output becomes stable, according to the
project's reported enable-cycle definition.

## Verification and Testing

The project evaluates the designs through MATLAB analysis, RTL
simulation, and hardware measurements.

Test scenarios documented in the project include: - **Multi-tone
input:** 50 Hz, 2 kHz, and 3 kHz components. - **Single-tone inputs:**
150 Hz and 250 Hz to examine passband preservation and attenuation
around the cutoff; a 350 Hz case is also reported for the second-order
DF1 implementation. - **DC input:** 1.65 V to inspect steady-state
behavior. - **Cross-checking:** comparison of MATLAB reference results,
Verilog simulation, and hardware output. - **Implementation analysis:**
Vivado resource utilization and post-route timing reports.
